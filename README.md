==========TROUBLESHOOTING EDITOR LAYOUT ISSUES ==========
Hey guys, if you encounter the double window issue, 
it's a problem related to the editor's layout.

If it asks you to reload, just press quit, it should open the second time.
After that modify the layout to 4x4 so it resets (top right corner).
